# Work-Day-Scheduler

# Description 
In this project, we were assigned to make a daily planner that would save our logs to our console. So we had to create the HTML and CSS then connect everything in the JS file. We also had to add a save button that would actually save our entries. The main challenged I faced in the particular project was getting everything to come together as one. After a couple hair pulling moments I was able to get everything to come together.
